# Haiti Independence Debt Visualization

An interactive timeline visualizing Haiti’s colonial indemnity and related “double debt” from 1804–1947.  
Built as a learning project exploring data ingestion, database seeding, API development, UI design, and deployment with a full CI/CD workflow (GitHub → Vercel → Neon).

---

## ⭐ Project Overview

Haiti declared independence in 1804, but in 1825 France imposed a massive indemnity—150 million gold francs—under threat of invasion.  
Because Haiti could not pay upfront, it was forced into a high‑interest loan from French banks. Historians call this structure the **“double debt”**:  
1. The indemnity itself  
2. The loan taken out to pay the indemnity  

This project visualizes year‑by‑year payments and outstanding balances based on the **New York Times’ 2022 investigation, _The Ransom_**, combined with historical narrative context.

## 🧪 Local Development

### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Add database URL
Create a `.env` file:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
```

### 3. Seed the database (local only)
```bash
npx ts-node scripts/seed.ts
```

### 4. Run dev server
```bash
npm run dev
```

---

## 🚀 Deployment (Vercel)

- Commit to a feature branch
- Push → GitHub PR
- Vercel builds a **preview deployment**
- After merging → production updates automatically

Ensure `DATABASE_URL` is added in  
**Vercel → Project Settings → Environment Variables**.
